## What is NeutronDesk?
### It's a customizable Windows 10 style window for your Electron Apps, Easy, Fast and Lightweight!
## First take in
In your index.html, you have to include the style first on the head:
```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="NeutronDesk/ressources/style.css">
</head>
```
Then create the titlebar container, app content and import your scripts:
```html
<body>
    <header></header>
    <div class="app-content">
        Your content here
    </div>
    <script>
        require('NeutronDesk/index.js');
    </script>
</body>
```
